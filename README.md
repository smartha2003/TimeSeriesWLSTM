# ðŸ§  Time Series Forecasting with LSTM: Predicting Shampoo Sales

This project is part of my ongoing journey into learning **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks and their applications in time series forecasting. I implemented and adapted this project by following [Jason Brownlee's tutorial on LSTM forecasting](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/) to strengthen my foundational understanding of sequence modeling in deep learning.

> ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Predict future monthly shampoo sales using historical data with a stateful LSTM network.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

âœ… How to reframe time series data as a **supervised learning** problem  
âœ… The importance of making time series **stationary** (differencing)  
âœ… How to **scale** data correctly for neural network training  
âœ… Building, training, and evaluating an **LSTM network** in Keras  
âœ… Using **walk-forward validation** (rolling forecasts)  
âœ… Comparing model performance to a **persistence (baseline) model**

This project helped me move beyond just applying LSTMs â€” I started understanding **why** each preprocessing step matters and how **model architecture choices affect performance** in a temporal context.
